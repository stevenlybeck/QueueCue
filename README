QueueCue - Sep. 14, 2011

This project is a collection of two simple JavaScript objects which define a clear and powerful pattern for specifying the execution of a series of JavaScript functions. Functions can either be executed in sequence (through the use of QC.serial) or at the same time (through the use of QC.parallel).

Functions called by QueueCue must follow one rule - whenever they consider themselves to be "done", they must call the callback that was provided as the final argument in the function's argument list. (i.e., arguments[arguments.length-1]();)

The 'run' method of QueueCue objects abides by this one rule, meaning QueueCue objects can also be combined together. This allows you to build complex execution patterns with clear code.


So, some examples:

// load three scripts simultaneously, and execute a function for each that is dependent on its respective script
// do this as quickly as possible, then 

var allScripts = new QC.parallel();

var script1 = new QC.serial();
script1.push(loadScript, ['script1.js']);
script1.push(function() { alertHiFromScript1(); arguments[arguments.length-1](); });

var script2 = new QC.serial();
script2.push(loadScript, ['script2.js']);
script2.push(function() { alertHiFromScript2(); arguments[arguments.length-1](); });

var script3 = new QC.serial();
script3.push(loadScript, ['script3.js']);
script3.push(function() { alertHiFromScript3(); arguments[arguments.length-1](); });


allScripts
.push(script1.run)
.push(script2.run)
.push(script3.run);

allScripts.run();


function loadScript() {
  var _cb = arguments[arguments.length-1];
  
  // script loading code goes here
  // attach events to script loading process - when done, call _cb();
  // voila - when the script is done loading, it returns control to its QueueCue and allows execution to continue on that channel
}
